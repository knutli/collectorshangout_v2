# Welcome to Collectors Hangout

This project is being developed by GPT4, with a "human assistant" acting as a facilitator and seamstress of the code.

It is created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Background

Large marketplaces today are plagued with scams and fake items. Why? Because these marketplaces cannot afford (or be bothered?) to put in place systems to validate the items being sold. It's an inherently reactive approach to validation, not proactive.

Collectors Hangout is made to become a network of community-powered marketplaces, where individual contributors, moderators and experts can validate the items that are being put up for sale. When applying this across a series of markets, we can ensure higher quality items, less scammy actors and increased trust.
