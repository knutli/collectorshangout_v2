# Welcome to Collectors Hangout

## Background

Large marketplaces today are plagued with scams and fake items.

Oase is made to become a network of community-powered marketplaces. We use AU combined with individual contributors, moderators and experts to validate the items that are being put up for sale. When applying this across a series of markets, we can ensure higher quality items, less scammy actors and increased trust.

## Run the app locally
Frontend and backend runs separately. Navigate to /client and /server, and start the app by running `npm run`. First in /server, then in /client.
